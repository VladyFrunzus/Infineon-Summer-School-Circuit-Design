# Infineon-Summer-School-Circuit-Design
This repository contains a circuit design which I did as part of Infineon's Summer School 2023.

The contents of the folder are:

- rtl (Register-Transfer Level), which contains the abstraction of the circuit's design model.
- tb (Test Bench), which contains the files used for simulating a simple test for the circuit.
